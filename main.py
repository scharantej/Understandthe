 The provided feedback highlights several areas for improvement in the design of the Flask application. To address these concerns, the following improvements can be made:

1. **Clear Problem Statement:** Clearly define the purpose and scope of the project in a concise and well-structured problem statement. This will help ensure a focused and well-directed approach throughout the development process.

2. **Detailed Design:** Provide a more detailed design for the Flask application, including specific information about the HTML files, routes, and any additional components or features. This will help ensure a well-structured and organized codebase, making it easier to implement and maintain.

3. **Enhanced UX Considerations:** Incorporate user experience (UX) considerations into the design to improve the overall usability and accessibility of the website. This may involve designing user-friendly interfaces, ensuring responsive layouts, and considering accessibility features.

4. **Proper Variable Referencing:** Ensure that all variables used in the Flask application are properly referenced in the HTML files. This will prevent errors and ensure that the application functions as intended.

5. **Code Validation:** Conduct thorough code validation to identify and correct any errors or issues in the Flask code. This will help ensure the reliability and stability of the application.

By implementing these improvements, the design of the Flask application can be enhanced to address the concerns raised in the feedback and ensure a successful implementation.
