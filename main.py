This code creates a Flask application with four routes:

1. `/`: This route renders the `index.html` page, which is the home page of the website.
2. `/movies`: This route renders the `movies.html` page, which lists all the Telugu movies in the database.
3. `/movie/<movie_id>`: This route renders the `movie_details.html` page, which provides detailed information about a specific movie.
4. `/contact`: This route renders the `contact.html` page, which provides contact information for the website owner or administrator.

The code also connects to a SQLite database called `telugu_movies.db` to retrieve information about the movies. The database is expected to have a table called `movies` with columns such as `id`, `title`, `release_year`, `director`, and `主演`.

The code uses the `render_template()` function to render the HTML pages and the `url_for()` function to generate URLs for the different routes.

To validate the code, you can check the following:

1. Make sure that the HTML files (`index.html`, `movies.html`, `movie_details.html`, and `contact.html`) are properly formatted and have the correct references to the variables in the Python code.
2. Make sure that the database connection is established correctly and that the queries to retrieve movie information are correct.
3. Test the different routes by accessing them in a web browser and verify that the pages are rendered correctly and the data is displayed as expected.

Once you have validated the code, you can run the Flask application using the `app.run()` method. The `debug=True` argument enables debug mode, which is useful for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
